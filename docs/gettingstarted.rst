Getting Started
=======

Creating the files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can find a wide range of premade plugins on the `Poggit Release <https://poggit.pmmp.io>`_ plugin platform.

Installing/updating a plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plugin developers usually distribute plugins as `phar <http://php.net/manual/en/phar.using.intro.php>`_ files. These files can be easily loaded by placing them in your ``plugins`` folder in the server data folder.

Be sure to **delete old versions of the plugin**, and **restart the server** to see changes.

Writing your own plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can find resources for plugin development at the `DeveloperDocs GitHub repository <https://github.com/pmmp/DeveloperDocs>`_.
